We were given a CSV containing 34,000 applications from 19,568 organizations. The following report is a brief explanation of the model. I used TensorFlow as it can handle large amounts of data, and analyze complex patterns. The report covers data preprocessing, compiling, training, and evaluation. By the end, we will understand why I chose this particular model."],"metadata":{"id":"365D3VN2Bj63"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Data Preprocessing\n","----\n","####1. What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?\n","\n","####The \"Is-Successful\" column was the variable the model targeted. The whole point of the model is to see which applicants paid back which loans successfully, and which were not. The only feature that definitely answered this was \"Is-Successful\".\n","---\n","####2. What variable(s) are the features for your model?\n","\n","####The variables used for the features for this model are: NAME, APPLICATION, TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, STATUS, and ASK_AMT\n","---\n","####3. What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?\n","\n","####For the optmitizer, I removed the EIN, or Employment Identification Number. Since we have the name of the organization or applicant, the EIN is effectively useless and could even create noise within the model from numbers that had no influence on the outcome of success or no.\n","\n","####STATUS was also removed as all values were the same (1), making the feature hyper-clustered and effectively useless.\n","\n","####SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS could be removed as these were objects that would not be able to be converted into the appropriate datatype for a model.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"2CoY3KB4Bjyl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model\n","----\n","####1. How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?\n","\n","#### While this orignially seemed like a simple classification model requiring only one layer of neurons, it needed more as I found the accuracy was not able to exceed 53% with just one. I experimented with changing the number of epochs and layers, and while 100 epochs verified the persistence of the model, just 10 epochs seemed to achieve almost the same results within a few hundredth points. Using multiple layers was the key to moving the accuracy above 75%, as was increasing the size of the random state from 2 to at least above 50 (I chose 99). I used 'relu' for the first activation function, and 'sigmoid' for any subsequent and output layers.\n","---\n","####2. Were you able to achieve the target model performance?\n","\n","#### Yes - 80%\n","---\n","####3. What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?\n","\n","#### Steps to increase model performance included grouping outlying values in the features NAME, APPLICATION_TYPE, CLASSIFICATION, and ASK_AMT. It also comprised adjusting the number of layers, activation function placement, number of units, number of random states. Encoding the NAME column into numeric seemed to have the greatest effect for improving accuracy, which makes sense as the model was not able to form a relationship between the target and the other features it was training on."],"metadata":{"id":"xTMKu3jZBjqF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Summary\n","----\n","####In conclusion, the model is able to accurately predict successful applications, to a degree of 80%, as long as the application has the following criteria:\n","- The application must have one of the following classifications, under CLASSIFICATION; C1000, C2000, C3000, C1200, C2100\n","- The application must have used one of the following application types, under APPLICATION_TYPE: T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, T10, T19\n","- The ASK_AMT = 5000\n","- The applicant, under NAME, must have submitted an application more than 5 times\n","\n","\n","####A different model I would recommend is the Random Forest model as it produced an accuracy score of 79.5%, almost identical to TensorFlow. Random Forest is good for classification and regression tasks. I also experimented using K-Nearest Neighbors, although this produced slightly less accurate result of 78.6%.
