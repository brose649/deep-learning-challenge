# deep-learning-challenge
This is the repository for the neural networks and deep learning challenge. We were tasked creating a tool, a model, that predicts whether or not a hypothetical applicant will succeed in their ventures, if given funding. We were given a CSV containing 34,000 applications from 19,568 organizations. The following report is a brief explanation of the model. I used TensorFlow as it can handle large amounts of data, and analyze complex patterns. The report covers data preprocessing, compiling, training, and evaluation. By the end, we will understand why I chose this particular model.
